# DPhi
A hospital in the province of Greenland has been trying to improve its care conditions by looking at historic survival of the patients. They tried looking at their data but could not identify the main factors leading to high survivals.


# Objective:
Now you are responsible for developing a model that will predict the chances of survival of a patient after 1 year of treatment (Survived_1_year).


# About the dataset:
The dataset contains the patient records collected from a hospital in Greenland. The "Survived_1_year" column is a target variable which has binary entries (0 or 1).
  * Survived_1_year == 0, implies that the patient did not survive after 1 year of treatment
  * Survived_1_year == 1, implies that the patient survived after 1 year of treatment
